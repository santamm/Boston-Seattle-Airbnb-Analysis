## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The code in this project is written in Python 3.6.6 :: Anaconda custom (64-bit).
The following additional libraries have been used:
- wordcloud to generate wordclouds from the text of the reviews
- langdetect to detect the languages of the review
- nltk for the Vader Sentiment Analyzer. The Vader lexicon has been downloaded nltk.downloader.download('vader_lexicon')

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In this project we analyze data from Airbnb listings for Seattle and Boston in 2016 and 2017. The methodology followed is CRISP-DM.
The questions we are trying to answer in this project are the following:
- Which features in the listings affect the price the most? which ones are more important in driving the price up?
- How does the rates between the two cities compare? Can we spot patterns in the seasonal or weekly data?
- Can we find a way to classify negative and positive reviews based on text?

The data has been made available by Airbnb inside, and the original source can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The Jupyter notebooks included in this project are:
- Prices and Trends.ipynb, with the code for comparing rates between the two cities and spot patterns in the seasonal or weekly data
- Reviews Sentiment Analysis.ipynb, with the code to analyze the text reviews
- Price Prediction Analysis.ipynb, the code include a linear regression model to predict price and find what features affect the prices the most

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The following results are showed in the notebooks:
- Which features in the listings affect the price the most? which ones are more important in driving the price up?

- How does the rates between the two cities compare? Can we spot patterns in the seasonal or weekly data?
